## 🚀 About me
I’m a university student learning software development from scratch — step by step, project by project.  
I like building tools that make life easier for students and turning pressure into progress.

Right now, I’m working on a **personal Study Flow app** for students who struggle to study under high pressure.

## 🧠 What I’m focusing on (right now)
- Strong fundamentals (problem solving, clean code, debugging)
- Building real projects + learning proper dev workflow (Git, teamwork, docs)
- Improving consistency: *small progress every day > perfect someday*
